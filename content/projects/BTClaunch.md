The uproar from Wall Street can be seen as comical, as they echoed extreme statements comparing Wall Street Bets (WSB), a popular investing subreddit, to capitol riots, calling for regulation to restrict retail traders and their outlets to invest, and equating the WSB community to Mavericks driven by greed who will ultimately get hurt. This is the wrong perspective.
