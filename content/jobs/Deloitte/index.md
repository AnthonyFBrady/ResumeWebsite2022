<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">Deloitte is the largest professional services network by revenue and number of professionals in the world and is considered one of the Big Four accounting firms along with EY, KPMG and PwC.</span><br/><br/>

- As the path to transition to a PM role is unclear, I determined the skills I needed to develop and experiences I wanted to have, and realized consulting would lead me towards this desired outcome. Since joining Deloitte, I have taken every opportunity to hone these previously identified skills.
- I drove the development of our internal support process through requirements gathering and ideation sessions with our engineering and stakeholder engagement teams, developed a data-driven reporting strategy—from ideation to execution—used to inform Deloitte and CBSA decision making during a critical onboarding project phase, and honed my capacity to lead and build team chemistry through democratic leadership and empathy. I have also volunteered to lead newsletter engagement across Deloitte Canada of which I have introduced Qualtrics surveys and iteratively refined the content to align with reader feedback. In all my work thus far, even in writing, I have been searching for opportunities and feedback to refine my skills and better prepare myself for a career in PM.
