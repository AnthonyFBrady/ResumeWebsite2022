<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">Deloitte is the largest professional services network by revenue and number of professionals in the world and is considered one of the Big Four accounting firms along with EY, KPMG and PwC.</span><br/><br/>

- As there is no clear-cut path to PM, I reflected on the skills I needed to develop and the subsequent actions required. I cross referenced the output of these sessions with books, podcasts, and discussions with current PMs to ensure my plan holistically addressed the required skills. I concluded that consulting in a technical area, given my non-technical background, would lead me towards this desired outcome.
- During my tenure at Deloitte, I have actively cultivated the skill set necessary for successful product management. I have spearheaded the development of our internal support process by conducting comprehensive requirements gathering, facilitating ideation sessions, and fostering cross-functional collaboration with both our engineering and stakeholder engagement teams. Additionally, I have formulated a data-driven reporting strategy that provides crucial insights for Deloitte and our clients, all while refining my leadership abilities through a democratic approach and empathetic guidance.
- In a more specialized capacity, I have taken the initiative to lead newsletter engagement efforts across Deloitte Canada. Employing surveys, I have iteratively tailored content to align with reader feedback, effectively enhancing reader engagement. Beyond my primary project responsibilities, I have discovered immense satisfaction in actively participating in product development and go-to-market strategies, as well as contributing to campus recruitment events, newsletter development, and broader practice-wide learning and development initiatives.
