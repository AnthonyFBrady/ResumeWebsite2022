<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">The Centre for Faculty Development (CFD) is a partnership between Unity Health Toronto and the University of Torontoâ€™s Temerty Faculty of Medicine.</span><br/><br/>

- During my graduate-level education, I fulfilled an internship requirement at Unity Health, where I worked in the research service area. During my tenure, I excelled in facilitating the dissemination of knowledge to a diverse audience of scholars and clinicians. I spearheaded the development of a web-based resource focused on evaluation and implementation science, effectively catering to the specific needs of our varied audience.

In the process of crafting this resource, I conducted comprehensive interviews with key stakeholders from both Unity Health and the Centre for Faculty Development (CFD) leadership. These discussions unearthed crucial insights into the necessary steps for achieving their desired outcomes, distinct from their initial preferences and inclinations.

Moreover, I actively contributed to the enhancement of communication strategies for The Centre for Faculty Development's research and evaluation endeavors. I achieved this by conceptualizing and producing engaging virtual resources in the form of informative and creative videos, thereby offering practical support and guidance for their activities.
