<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">The Centre for Faculty Development (CFD) is a partnership between Unity Health Toronto and the University of Torontoâ€™s Temerty Faculty of Medicine.</span><br/><br/>

- I worked at Unity Health in the research service area to meet the internship requirement for my graduate level education. While in this role, I achieved successful knowledge mobilization for a **diverse audience of scholars and clinicians**, by leading the development of a web-based resource on evaluation and implementation science. To inform the design of this resource, I conducted interviews with Unity Health and the Centre for Faculty Development (CFD) leadership where what they should do to reach their desired outcome, as opposed to what they want to do, was identified. I also had the opportunity to create videos provide practical **communication strategy support** for The Centre for Faculty Development research and evaluation activities by creating creative **virtual resources** ([videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqZhSjFf9c&ab_channel=LongStoryShort)) and **work products**.
