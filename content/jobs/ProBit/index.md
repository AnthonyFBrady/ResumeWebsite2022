<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">ProBit Global is an international Top 20 crypto exchange in real daily trading volume that has successfully completed over 200 rounds of IEO.</span><br/><br/>

- My move to South Korea was motivated by the belief that international work experience and study can have a lasting positive impression on professionals, tasking communicators to acclimate to different schools of thought, living arrangements, and languages, necessitating considerable self-appraisal and growth in autonomy, adaptability, and character development. I have learned through my study of Korean that communicating with a limited vocabulary is akin to the skills for explaining complex concepts and ideas; essential competencies for professional communicators and academics to develop succinct communications.

- During my time at ProBit Global, an esteemed international cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in South Korea, I actively contributed to the company's strategic brand development efforts. One of our key objectives revolved around establishing ProBit as a leading authority in the blockchain and emerging technology sphere. Given the prevalent skepticism surrounding cryptocurrency companies, cultivating a sense of trustworthiness within this dynamic landscape was paramount to our success.

- To effectively bolster our credibility, I adopted a strategic approach that involved crafting technical and financial commentaries. Through these insightful analyses, I not only highlighted disruptive emerging technology convergences but also provided comprehensive explanations of significant cryptocurrency market events, including market corrections. Additionally, I connected these events to the traditional finance space, thereby enhancing our perceived reliability and expertise in the eyes of both existing and potential users.

- Furthermore, we meticulously monitored Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores over time, and it was gratifying to observe a notable improvement in the trust perceptions among our user base. While it's challenging to establish a direct link, I firmly believe that these efforts significantly contributed to the remarkable milestone of reaching 1 million unique users, signifying the substantial progress made by the company during my tenure.
