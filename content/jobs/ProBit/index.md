<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">ProBit Global is an international Top 20 crypto exchange in real daily trading volume that has successfully completed over 200 rounds of IEO.</span><br/><br/>

- My move to South Korea was motivated by the belief that international work experience and study can have a lasting positive impression on professionals, tasking communicators to acclimate to different schools of thought, living arrangements, and languages, necessitating considerable self-appraisal and growth in autonomy, adaptability, and character development. I have learned through my study of Korean that communicating with a limited vocabulary is akin to the skills for explaining complex concepts and ideas; essential competencies for professional communicators and academics to develop succinct communications.

- While at ProBit I honed my research and writing abilities through development of press releases and newsletters, drafting technical writing for third-party publishing, and developing video tutorials to enhance the user troubleshooting experience. These experiences offered me insight into all levels of the communications process and despite there being many hurdles and challenges along the way, instilled in me a resolute desire to further my professional education.
