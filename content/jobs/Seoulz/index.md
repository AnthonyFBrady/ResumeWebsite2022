<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">Seoulz is a digital media startup with a focus on startup and technology news.</span><br/><br/>

- In an effort to establish myself professionally in Korea and accumulate professional writing experience, I reached out to the creator of Seoulz and inquired about writing and or work opportunities. Since then I have published seven articles on a variety of topics, ranging from social media engagement, employee retention, and technology trends. As these articles are not in areas I was very well-versed in but were typically just areas of interest, each article required a substantial time investment into research and development.
