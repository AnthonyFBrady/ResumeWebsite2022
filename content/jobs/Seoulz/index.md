<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">Seoulz is a digital media startup with a focus on startup and technology news.</span><br/><br/>

- In my pursuit to establish a professional presence in Korea and expand my repertoire of professional writing, I proactively connected with the creator of Seoulz, expressing my interest in potential writing and work opportunities. Subsequently, I had the privilege of contributing to their platform, having published a total of seven articles on diverse subjects. These pieces delved into a wide array of topics, encompassing social media engagement, employee retention strategies, and evolving technology trends.

- Although these areas weren't initially within my realm of expertise, they represented topics of personal interest that I was eager to explore. As a result, each article demanded a significant investment of time and effort, involving thorough research and meticulous development to ensure the delivery of high-quality content. This opportunity was one that I truly cherished and appreciated, as it not only facilitated my professional growth but also enabled me to cultivate a deeper understanding of various subject matters.
