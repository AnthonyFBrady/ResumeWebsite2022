<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">JSL is a plastic manufacturing company which uses quality-engineered materials to manufacture plastic seals and foot valves required for the mining industry.</span><br/><br/>

- During my professional journey, I demonstrated a keen aptitude for both product development and sales strategy. At the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS), I spearheaded the successful wholesale of a new product, resulting in an impressive 800% surge in sales. This accomplishment was realized through the meticulous creation of impactful company banners, brochures, business cards, persuasive product proposals, and the seamless design of a captivating website and logos, skillfully crafted using Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator.

- Simultaneously, my role at Jelka Seals presented an exciting opportunity to drive the development of a highly profitable smell-proof container, generating substantial monthly revenue ranging between $10,000 and $20,000. Recognizing the potential market expansion following the legalization of cannabis, I undertook a comprehensive process of product ideation, differentiation, and marketing. To achieve this, I recommended the repurposing of a retired mould, incorporating crucial modifications such as a high quality O-ring. Our strategic marketing approach involved leveraging prominent online platforms such as Amazon, alongside a robust wholesale strategy.

- The hallmark of our product's success lay in the superior quality of the o-ring, a pivotal element that ensured the product's unmatched capability to contain odors. Through a rigorous process of comparative analysis, involving both astute and playful testing methods, we unequivocally established our product's superiority over competitors, thereby justifying its slightly premium pricing strategy. This comprehensive approach not only fortified our market position but also solidified our reputation for delivering reliable and high-quality solutions.
