<span style="color: #b8c2e2;">Humber College has a reputation for being one of Canadaâ€™s most diverse, comprehensive, and exciting colleges in Canada.</span><br/><br/>

- I effectively enhanced Humber's international recruitment efforts during my internship by employing a data-driven approach, which resulted in a significant increase in engagement from our target countries. Monthly, I diligently presented actionable analytics to the leadership team, facilitating informed decision-making and the implementation of strategic adjustments to our initiatives.

- Moreover, I actively contributed to the reinforcement of the Humber International brand by playing a pivotal role in the development of the new Humber International website. Additionally, I was involved in the creation of compelling content for newspapers and blogs, effectively amplifying the institution's global presence and reinforcing its unique offerings.

- This valuable internship experience allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a practical setting, furthering my understanding of international recruitment strategies and brand development within the education sector.
