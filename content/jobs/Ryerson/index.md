- As a Graduate Assistant for CMN 432: Communication in the Engineering Professions, working closely under the supervision of Dr. Mudry & Dr. Seko, I took the lead in facilitating an online AI-driven learning simulation (Ametros Learning). This initiative resulted in a significant increase in student class completion rates, accompanied by commendable feedback from the professors involved. My responsibilities encompassed effectively addressing troubleshooting submissions, rectifying technical errors, and offering constructive criticism on various aspects of professional communication and persuasive writing.

- Notably, my efforts directly contributed to the successful participation of 50 engineering undergraduates in the AI-driven learning simulation, leading to an impressive average performance surge of 9%. This achievement underlined my dedication to achieving measurable outcomes and fostering a healthy learning environment for the students.

- In recognition of my exceptional performance, I was promoted to a leadership position, where I skillfully supervised a team of 5 talented graduate assistants. This promotion highlighted my commitment to excellence and showcased my proficiency in guiding and managing a team within an academic setting.
